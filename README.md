MirahezeBots is an IRC bot mainly used by [Miraheze](https://meta.miraheze.org)
([#miraheze on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=miraheze)).

It is simple and easy to customize.
MirahezeBot uses [Sopel](https://sopel.chat).

To use this bot, simply type install 'MirahezeBot-Plugins' from PyPi and then run 'sopel configure --plugins'

To make use of the beta branch, clone the repo and check the 'dev' branch out and use pip's "install ." function to install it. You can then use 'sopel configure --plugins' as normal.

Please note that in line with our security policy, we can only support Sopel 7.0.5 - 8.0 installations running Python 3.7+.
