# mh_phab
This has been completely rewrote to be more efficent.
We've introduced more config options as well.
# dbclean
This is a new cli script to help clean up databases
# adminlist
Now uses the owner/admin account config rather than nickname.
# channelmgnt
You can now set modes, we've improved documentation and fixed a few bugs
# find_updates
Has been replaced by the upstream version
# joinall (was join)
We've removed the join control and replaced it with joinall that forces the bot to join all channels in your config file
# responses
Has had some merged from other responses and no longer breaks with spaces
# status
Now works with non cloaked users
# welcome
Now also recongises accounts
# Requirements
We changed the way we install things from pip.
You only need to install requirments.txt but you might find pip-install.txt has some more fun modules on.
